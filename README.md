# Titanic ML Competition Repository

Welcome to my GitHub repository for the Titanic ML Competition on Kaggle. This project is a showcase of my work in data science and machine learning, where I developed a predictive model to determine which passengers were more likely to survive the infamous Titanic shipwreck.

## Project Overview
In this project, I explored the Titanic dataset containing passenger details such as name, age, gender, and socio-economic class. I applied various techniques in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development to answer the central question:  
**"What types of passengers were more likely to survive?"**

## Results
- **Cross-validated accuracy**: 0.8384  
- **Submission file saved**

## Repository Structure
- **data/**: Contains the training and test datasets.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model development.
- **src/**: Python scripts for data processing and model building.
- **submission/**: Generated submission files.
- **README.md**: This document.

Thank you for checking out my work on this exciting challenge!
